# BoneLab2.0
This repository contains the updated code for the Bio Anthropology virtual reality lab.
Original Creation: Wellesley College August 2017 Anth1.1 created by Kamile Lukosiute, Adam Van Arsdale, and Jordan Tynes.
Present: Contains updated implementations by Nyala Jackson on said project during the Vassar 2019 Ford Scholars Program for the Anthropology Department, headed by Professor Zachary Cofran. Additions include: "Probe Mode" a feature activated on Grip Button press on the HTC Vive Pro controller that allows users to obtain information on a bone (id, species, geological age, site location, and similar specimens); "Timeline," an activity that asks the user to place an assortment of bones in the correct place on a timeline using fossils that have been pre-placed for reference; an updated else statement in UI_SelectionMenu.cs; the if conditional within bHit in UI_LaserPointer.cs that checks if the grip button has been pressed, and the variables: inParent, savedBone, and willExit. 
To Note: I also added additional fossils/assets/prefabs/packages (which were also added to the selection menu), but they are not included in this repository. Updated diagram and interaction instructions in Load scene are also not included in this repository. Fossil packages are not updated to contain their text files.  

If you were involved in the 1.1 project and wish to be added as a contributer, please email me at nyalajackson@yahoo.com, and I will surely add you.
