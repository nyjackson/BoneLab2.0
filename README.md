# BoneLab2.0
This repository contains the updated code for the bone lab.
Original Creation: Wellesey College August 2017 Anth1.1 
Present: Contains updated implementations by Nyala Jackson on said project during the Vassar 2019 Ford Scholars Program for the Anthropology Department, headed by Professor Zachary Cofran. Additions include: "Probe Mode" a feature activated on Grip Button press on the HTC Vive Pro controller that allows users to obtain information on a bone (id, species, geological age, site location, and similar specimens); "Timeline," an activity that asks the user to place an assortment of bones in the correct place on a timeline using fossils that have been pre-placed for reference.
